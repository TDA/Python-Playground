### Python Playground
* The purpose of this repo is to provide me with a BUNCH of python code that I write.
* This will be multistacked, much like my first steps repos in other languages.
* The reason I chose to name this as playground instead of first steps is 
because, Python. Play. Sounds better. 
* Also, EIBTI, so will be specifying explicitly whether the program is in Py2 
or Py3. I like calling them that :)
* When possible/necessary I will be writing the same program in both Py2 and Py3, 
just to showcase the differences between the two beautiful versions. 
Yes, surprisingly, I love them both :)
